One of his many works, \"On the Mixtures and Powers of Simple Drugs,\" was an important pharmaceutical text that would help educate fellow Greek-Roman doctors.\n\nThe text was translated during the 6th century into Syriac, a language that served as a bridge between Greek and Arabic and helped spread Galen's ideas into the ancient Islamic world. But despite the physician's fame, the most complete surviving version of the translated manuscript was erased and written over with hymns in the 11th century \u2013 a common practice at the time. These written-over documents are known as palimpsests.\nhttps://phys.org/news/2018-03-hidden-medical-text-thousand-years.html\nThese links are pulled from the John Anthony West digest, curated by Steve Detwiler.

Open adoption for any who may be curious.\nHer birthday is on the 30th of this month, coincidentally, that is the night of a blue moon, following, so I have made our little moon princess a lovely nature crown\nI tied a small pearl into the arch of the crown with a bit of wire and stifling silver chain, this is much to big for my daughter now, but I based the size off me, and my wife\u2019s head, so someday in the future she may be able to wear this.\nAnother view of the crown, the circlet next to the head is a gift of appreciation to the adoptive mother.\nTop view, I had a lot of fun doing this, and I\u2019ve never worked with wire or vines before so this was a lovely experience. I hope you\u2019ve enjoyed this, take a look at some of the weaponry work in my other profile posts, which is my main focus.", "image_urls": "//i.imgur.com/goVghVnr.jpg, //i.imgur.com/goVghVnr.jpg, //i.imgur.com/VTc7V3br.jpg, //i.imgur.com/VTc7V3br.jpg, //i.imgur.com/QOzE4Rjr.jpg, //i.imgur.com/QOzE4Rjr.jpg, //i.imgur.com/xkv5Kerr.jpg, //i.imgur.com/xkv5Kerr.jpg, //i.imgur.com/StdniNor.jpg, //i.imgur.com/StdniNor.jpg", "op": "//imgur.com/user/DwarvenDesign"},

By the state of my home, my demeanor, all of it. I know his cruel when his drunk but... I don't know how to feel or what to do. They took him away. He has to go to a hospital to detox before they talk to him and take a statement. So he won't be released for several days. It doesn't feel real. \n\nI don't\u00a0know how to feel about being the 'victim' I haven't made an official complaint which I hope means they won't charge him. \n\nBut the officer kept saying abuse again and again and now it's starting to sink in all those times he was controlling, manipulative and threatened me with violence, are not ok. It's like I can finally see clearly.\n\nHis taken my interior support system away from me. I have no one I can call. None of his family know his even an alcoholic.

Lt Col Olds decided to show his displeasure in an act of difiance and that was to grow and extravagantly waxed mustache that was out of military regs.  While this displeased some of the higher ups Olds was a 3 time ace and had served in WW2 so there wasn't a whole lot they could do that worried him, plus it boosted his troops morale.\n\nNow every March many members of the USAF grow mustaches not only in honor of him but to show our own act of defiance.  It isn't as big of a deal as far as breaking regs as there are contests held at many bases as to who can grow the best/worst mustache in a month.\n\nSo, if you happen to live near an Air Force base and see alot more dudes rocking nasty mustaches in the month of March now you know why.\n\nTLDR - Robin Olds \"started\" Mustache March in the Vietnam war.", "image_urls": "//i.imgur.com/fDbK2aL.jpg", "op": "//imgur.com/user/IMissPooping"},

I'm starting out with only 15 birds, six hens and nine cocks (as far as I can tell), and not all of them were banded so I'm not entirely sure what some of their lineages are at this point. The two birds shown above are the parents of this nest; the yellow bird on the left, \"2012-1\", is the hen and the red bird on the right, \"2015-407\", is the cock.\nDay 1: First hatch of the year on March 21, 2018. So far only one squab has hatched, but the other has pipped its shell and should be out by tomorrow morning.\nDay 2: Both squabs are out now. The one on the left with a darker beak is the older of the two. You can already see that it's a bit bigger than its sibling.\nDay 3: The second hatchling is a bit more active now.\nDay 4: The first squab to hatch is already showing signs of opening its eyes.\nDay 5: Hello there! Finally starting to notice their surroundings.\nDay 6: A bit chilly today, so they didn't really want to be out of their nest for long.\nDay 6 (cont): This little one is big enough to be banded now!\nDay 7: Now both babies are banded. You can see the new band on the smaller one in this picture. I'll start taking pictures of each individually now that they're getting so big.

I will try everything that I post beforehand along with mention biases I may have, or mention that I have not tried it due to financial or personal reasons but that may still be of interest. So far my general categories are (Music/Movies/plays) (Games) (Hobbies) (Lifestyle) (Misc) Basically someday each week* I will make a post on a topic of some sort in this general format:\nTitle: \"Weekly Rec. (1,2,3...)\" (Category/audience) Topic\nPicture: Picture(s) of said topic, maybe a logo **\nBeginning of description: Brief summary (like a Tl;Dr but at the beginning) \nDescription: Write a review of whatever it is, why it's useful/fun, etc\n\n*I have not decided on a day, going between Friday/Saturday as those are common days, or mondays so I can give people something to think about during the week.\n** It will likely NOT be this logo, this is just something that my lacking-in-digital-artistry self whipped up in a few minutes for the sole reason of this post. (If someone made a logo, that would be fantastic! Pop your username on the image and send it my way)\n\nFor those who may be worried: I will NEVER post anything for financial or personal gain (I.E. no annoying ad's, gofundme's, or anything else that could lead to personal gain.) This is going to be simply for the betterment of the community and so I get to try things that imgurians or friends recommend to me or that I find online.

He suffered from Kyphosis which is a condition in which the spine in the upper back has an excessive curvature. The upper back, or thoracic region of the spine, is supposed to have a slight natural curve. The spine naturally curves in the neck, upper back, and lower back to help absorb shock and support the weight of the head. Basically lots of osteoporosis going on. We were good buddies in school. He also suffered from a speech impediment that caused him to stutter a lot. If anyone would mock or tease him, I'd always have his back. In his spirit, I'm playing his favorite artist, Armin Van Buuren at full volume. If you were still here B, we'd be sitting at a bar watching a hockey game, arguing over our favorite players.

{"url": "https://imgur.com/gallery/XpWL6", "title": "I convince people to donate bone marrow for a living. ", "description": "I commented on another user's post a about being a bone marrow match a few months ago and\n@kitfisto5\nsuggested I do a post on it! I am a Donor Recruitment Coordinator for DKMS, a non-profit and the largest bone marrow donor center in the world. We work to find and facilitate transplant matches for patients with blood cancers and blood diseases. This means I am basically on the front lines of the bone marrow donation process educating people about the national registry and working to dispel commons myths about being a marrow donor. I work pretty closely with our college program and most of my days consist of working with college students to host bone marrow registration drives on their campuses.\nOnly 30% of people have a match from a family member. That means 70% have to rely on a complete stranger to literally save their lives. It may not look like much but those bags are filled with about 600 new life-savers. It was pouring rain and trashbags were our very sophisticated method of transporting the samples without ruining them.\nMost people don't even know how to register as a potential donor but it looks a lot like this (my husband convinced his best friend to be my swab model that day). You fill out a form and we swab the inside of your cheek for a DNA sample. What we test is a section of DNA called your HLA characteristics.\nA common misconception is that a match is dependent on blood type but it is all about this little section of DNA. You can actually donate to someone with a different blood type than you. When this happens the patient's blood type changes and they produce their donor's blood type (along with inheriting their allergies) for the rest of their life. Science is neat\nBut what happens if you get called as match? Getting matched is rare...only 1% of people on the registry are called. For those who are a match,  80% of the time donating will look something like this! This is peripheral blood stem cell donation. Blood is removed from one arm, filtered through a machine to remove stem cells, and then returned to the opposite arm. Side effects include: achiness and fatigue from the protein injections given the days leading up, mild discomfort from the IV's , and 4 to 8 hours of Netflix and pizza (this is the amount of time it takes to donate and most people watch movies and eat while they are donating).\nOr this the other 20% of the time! If you are matched to baby or small child, we are gonna need that liquid marrow. Contrary to popular belief, this is not an exrutiating procedure. After arriving at the hospital you will be put under general anethesia and a needle with a syringe will be used to extract liquid marrow from your lower back pelvic bone (you feel none of this). It's outpatient so you go home within a few hours! Side effects include: a tenderness and bruising sensation on your lower back (Most people say it feels like they fell on ice and have a very bruised lower back for a week), limited physical activity for one week, and an excuse to take a strategically angled post-op butt photo.\nThe medical procedure is covered under the patient-in-need's insurance and DKMS will arrange and  cover transportation to and from the collection center (and someone of your choice to tag along), hotels and meals while you are there, and we fully reimburse you if you have to take any time off of work.\nSo why would someone go through a medical procedure for someone they don't even know? The most common answer I hear from our incredible donors: because it's the right thing to do. The gentelman pictured above is meeting the widow of the man who saved his life by donating bone marrow. Tragically his donor passed away from a heart attack a few months after he donated but he was able to say thank you to his donor's family. There are no words for the gradtitude these patients feel.\nWe are making some headway but less than half of people searching for a bone marrow transplant receive one. Pictured above is Darian Smith, an 8 year old who has been living with sickle cell anemia his entire life and now it's so severe he will need a bone marrow transplant to survive. Heritage plays a huge role in finding a match and because 70% of the registry is Caucasian, it will be even harder for him to find a match. This is the case for any minority with a blood cancer or blood disease searching for a match.\nAnother story that hits close to home is a family who lives in my area in St. Louis. The Murry Brothers all developed a rare genetic blood disorder called Diamond Blackfan Anemia. All four will need a bone marrow transplant to survive. With life expectancy not reaching much past early 30s and the oldest in his late 20s, time of the essence for these boys. Their family has personally registered more than 30,000 new donors which has helped to save 100 other patients but sadly, none of those matches were for their boys.", "image_urls": "//i.imgur.com/a7Arkss.jpg, //i.imgur.com/kjlO5nM.jpg, //i.imgur.com/Z3sq6jJ.jpg, //i.imgur.com/uLsKxpn.png, //i.imgur.com/NrX5gOl.jpg, //i.imgur.com/dgrRXmcr.jpg, //i.imgur.com/dgrRXmcr.jpg, //i.imgur.com/JJhSWzY.jpg, //i.imgur.com/JryNmS8r.jpg, //i.imgur.com/JryNmS8r.jpg, //i.imgur.com/khgprAD.jpg, //i.imgur.com/coIc88t.jpg", "op": "//imgur.com/user/livvieloue"},

Then we go on a date together and he says he lives with his parents (which is fine). But he can't stop making himself sound really dependent and juvenile which is a big turn off for me. On top of which I have to initiate any kisses and they're not that great. He doesn't really seem to know what he's doing and I'm super disappointed. Still like him but unsure if I want to see him again.\nWe skyped a couple times after that, things got hot and heavy and turns out he definitely know what he's doing - a complete turn around from our first date (guess he was just nervous) and I'm super excited to see him again. He comes over and we're about to have some fun when TURNS OUT my vagina is an impenetrable fortress. For some weird fucking reason I have a flap of skin that prevents him from entering without causing excruciating pain for me. The strangest part is I have had sex before and this wasn't an issue. He was really cool but I'm super bummed out about it and not sure what to do.

A person (not shown) drives the robot up to the door, points the hand at the door handle, then gives the 'GO' command, both at the beginning of the video and again at 42 seconds.  The robot proceeds autonomously from these points on, without help from a person.  A camera in the hand finds the door handle, cameras on the body determine if the door is open or closed and navigate through the doorway.  Software provides locomotion, balance and adjusts behavior when progress gets off track.  The ability to tolerate and respond automatically to disturbances like these improves successful operation of the robot.
